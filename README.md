# Current Projects:
A few of the projects I've got going are below:
- Computer Vision Repo: A collection of proof of concept Computer vision projects written in C++ and Python.
- Data Science Project / Analysis: I intend to put together a project in which I take a dataset from a site like Kaggle that has data on traffic violations across the states (if I can find one, otherwise I may need to stick to one state or do data scraping) and then visualize it using tools such as python dash. Afterwards I'll include conclusions or notable things that I find using the data.

As a note: most of my projects are private. If you'd like to learn more about a project on my website or resume, I can speak to it or get you a copy if you reach out.
