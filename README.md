# About Me:

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtruesda or Myron
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on software development projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with C, C++, Python, and Assembly
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : mtruesda@gmail.com
- ðŸ’» I moved from PopOS back to strictly developing on Mac!

# Current Projects:
I'm a little stretched at this time with coursework but some of the projects I plan to work on are listed below.
- Automatic Fish Feeder:
  The intention with this is to make a feeder that will feed my fish tank when I am not home in appropriate amounts using an arduino.
- BrickBuster:
  I plan to recreate an old retro game that I made using Python in high school and optimize my old code a little.
- Siteproject:
  This project is quite open-ended as I haven't quite decided what direction I want to take it. I just wanted to learn some javascript.
- MusicBot:
  A Bot intended to locally replace the voice bots that Youtube has recently shut down on discord.
