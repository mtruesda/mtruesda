# About Me:

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtruesda or Myron
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on software development and data engineering/science projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with C, Javascript, Python, and Assembly
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : mtruesda@gmail.com
- ðŸ’» I moved from PopOS back to strictly developing on Mac!

# Current Projects:
I'm a little stretched at this time with coursework but some of the projects I plan to work on are listed below.
- Data Science Project / Analysis: I intend to put together a project in which I take a dataset from a site like Kaggle that has data on traffic violations across the states (if I can find one, otherwise I may need to stick to one state or do data scraping) and then visualize it using tools such as python dash. Afterwards I'll include conclusions or notable things that I find using the data.
