# About Me:

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtruesda or Myron
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on software development and data engineering/science projects. I also want to start putting together a VR project!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with C++ and Python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : mtruesda@gmail.com
- ðŸ’» I moved from PopOS back to strictly developing on Mac but I've developed on Windows and Linux as well! I just prefer the Unix based operating systems.

# Current Projects:
A few of the projects I've got going are below:
- Website / Portfolio: I am working on putting together a website using react that will have my resume along my portolio details contained on it. I may integrate it with the data science project to try integrating two repositories.
- Data Science Project / Analysis: I intend to put together a project in which I take a dataset from a site like Kaggle that has data on traffic violations across the states (if I can find one, otherwise I may need to stick to one state or do data scraping) and then visualize it using tools such as python dash. Afterwards I'll include conclusions or notable things that I find using the data.
